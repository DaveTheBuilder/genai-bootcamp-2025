Instruction for an AI Model to Create Adaptive Conversations

Objective:Develop an adaptive conversation system using an LLM to generate and adjust dialogue based on user responses dynamically.Store conversation embeddings in ChromaDB using Amazon Titan Embeddings (amazon.titan-embed-text-v1) for efficient retrieval.

1. Conversation Structure

Each conversation consists of a prompt (e.g., "You enter a café and want to order coffee.")

The AI generates four response options, including one correct and three distractors.

User selects a response, and the AI evaluates correctness and adjusts the next dialogue accordingly.

Store conversation data as embeddings in ChromaDB for future retrieval.

2. Adaptive Behavior

If the user selects the correct answer:

Progress the conversation naturally.

Increase complexity gradually (e.g., adding more details, requiring a more nuanced response).

If the user selects an incorrect answer:

Provide feedback explaining why the response is incorrect.

Offer a hint or rephrase the question.

Retrieve similar past interactions from ChromaDB to reinforce learning.

If the user struggles repeatedly, suggest a simpler version of the topic.

3. Personalization & Memory

Track user responses and store performance data.

Convert conversations into embeddings using Amazon Titan Embeddings and store them in ChromaDB.

Retrieve similar conversations to personalize learning, ensuring that the content is relevant to the user's interests and proficiency level.

If the user performs well on a topic, introduce more advanced vocabulary/grammar to challenge them appropriately.

If the user struggles, reinforce concepts with repetition and alternative examples, such as different contexts or scenarios.

4. Randomization & Variety

Generate multiple variations of the same scenario to prevent memorization.

Allow slight variations in AI responses based on tone (formal/informal) and context (business, travel, casual).

Occasionally introduce unexpected elements (e.g., a waiter forgets the order, requiring improvisation).

5. Storing Conversations in ChromaDB

Generate Embeddings with Amazon Titan

Convert the conversation text into embeddings:

import boto3

bedrock = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")
response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId="amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
    contentType="application/json",
    accept="application/json",
    body='{"inputText": "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"}'
)
embedding = response['body'].read()

Store in ChromaDB

Save the embeddings for efficient retrieval:

import chromadb

client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="conversation_db")
collection = client.get_or_create_collection("conversations")
collection.add(
    ids=["conv_1"],
    embeddings=[embedding],
    metadatas=[{"topic": "greetings"}]
)

Retrieve past conversations dynamically to personalize the next dialogue step.

6. Speech & Voice Integration (Optional)

If the game includes speech recognition:

Prompt the user to speak their response instead of selecting an option.

Use speech-to-text (STT) to analyze pronunciation and grammar.

Provide real-time corrections and improvements.

7. API Design Considerations

Input:

User level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

Selected topic (e.g., "Ordering Food")

User's last response

Output:

Next AI-generated message

Four response choices (or prompt for spoken input)

Feedback based on the user's choice

Retrieved similar past conversations from ChromaDB

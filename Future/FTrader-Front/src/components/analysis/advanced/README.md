   - Advanced Analysis: Contains the new professional trading features

2. **Second-level tabs** organize the advanced features into logical groups:
   - First row: Pattern Recognition, Strategy Builder, Correlation Matrix
   - Second row: Risk Analytics, Market Regime Detection, Order Flow Analysis
   - Third row: Sentiment Analysis, Portfolio Optimization

3. **Implementation status**: All components are now fully functional and integrated into the application.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete implementation of all advanced components:
   - Risk Analytics
